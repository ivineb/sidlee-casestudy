          <p>The North Face wanted to push the boundaries of what it means to be an outdoor brand and showcase <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/featured/futurelight.html">FUTURELIGHT</a>, its newest and most advanced breathable-waterproof material made with nanospinning technology. Tested in the world’s toughest conditions, FUTURELIGHT is the first of its kind: waterproof gear that feels so soft it’s like a second skin, breathes as hard as you do, and defies what a breathable-waterproof fabric can be.
              To celebrate FUTURELIGHT, we developed a 360 multi-channel campaign that includes a teaser campaign hinting at what’s to come, content that showcases FUTURELIGHT’s innovation and unique benefits, and a strong campaign visual identity that commends a new way to view The North Face as a brand while challenging people to rethink what a waterproof fabric can be. Our hero anthem spot, Made to Defy, evokes the passion of having the courage to disrupt the ordinary, and challenges us to go further than we’ve ever gone before. Featuring print, digital, augmented reality and more, our campaign inspires people to defy their own limitations and explore the future with an awakened curiosity to take on the impossible.
